# HOME_VISION

Welcome to HOME_VISION, your ultimate solution for visualizing your dream home in 3D, estimating costs, and exploring AR/VR models.

### Getting Started
- **App**: This app is developed using Expo. To start, install dependencies using `npm i` and run the app with `npm start`.
- **AR/VR Models**: Download the provided APKs for AR/VR models. Install the APK and point it towards the respective marker images (e.g., model1.apk for model1.jpg).
- **ML Module**: The cost estimation ML module is available as a Jupyter notebook. Experiment with different parameters for accurate cost estimates.

### Features
- **3D Visualization**: Experience your house in stunning 3D, exploring every nook and corner.
- **AR/VR Models**: Augmented and Virtual Reality models for an immersive experience.
- **Cost Estimation**: Machine learning-powered cost estimation for your 3D models.
